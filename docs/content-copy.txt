"I'm an engineer with multiple degrees and skills gathered over a lifetime. My original goal was to help working people succeed. But I discovered that HR systems are designed to filter out qualified candidates - 75% get passed over because their resume doesn't have the exact keywords.

So I built this tool to give working professionals that extra edge, without having to rewrite your resume for every job. I made it as easy and affordable as possible, because everyone deserves a fair shot at their dream job."


Before you get all pissed off about the price do a google search for resume writing. With about 15 minutes of searching you will find it costs $150-$500 to get a one time resume. If you want a good resume that is up to date and easy to optimize make one here. I recommend using a computer for this part. Yes you can do it on a mobile device but the experience may be painful. You are responsible for your own career. Use appropriate language and be as detailed as possible. Putting in the work up front will yield best results when you optimize.
