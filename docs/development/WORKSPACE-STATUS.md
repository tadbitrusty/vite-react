# ResumeSniper Workspace Status
**Updated**: 2025-01-23

## Master Development Specification
**Primary Document**: `RESUMESNIPER-N8N-TO-HARDCODE-SPEC.md` ✅ ENHANCED

### What's Been Integrated:
- ✅ **Founder story & brand voice** (Navy veteran authenticity)
- ✅ **Finalized pricing strategy** (FREE → $5.99 → $7.99 → $8.99 → $9.99)
- ✅ **Two-button user flow** (First Time vs Returning User)
- ✅ **Template differentiation psychology** (trojan horse strategy)
- ✅ **Email-based fraud detection** (simple but effective)
- ✅ **Revenue-focused business rules** (protect revenue, ignore harmless patterns)
- ✅ **Stripe integration details** (product IDs, revenue tracking)

## Development Commands Ready:

### Continue Implementation:
`"Implement Session 1 from the ResumeSniper spec - build all deliverables autonomously"`

### Check Progress:
`"Recap progress on ResumeSniper migration - what's complete and what's next"`

### Debug Issues:
`"Fix [specific issue] in ResumeSniper based on spec requirements"`

## Key Business Decisions Finalized:

### Revenue Model:
- **Template differentiation**: Same content + different CSS = premium pricing
- **95%+ profit margins** on all templates
- **Email-based free trial**: One free resume per email address

### User Experience:
- **Two-button flow**: Eliminates confusion, forces clear choice
- **1x5 template layout**: Clean progression, mobile-friendly
- **Military-style authenticity**: No fake reviews, transparent pricing

### Technical Strategy:
- **Serverless architecture**: Zero server management overhead
- **Direct API calls**: Eliminate N8N middleware for speed
- **Local development**: Git push → 30-second deploys

## Ready for Production:
The enhanced specification contains everything needed for autonomous development while preserving all critical business and technical decisions from the exploration phase.

**Workspace is clean, focused, and ready for implementation.** 🚀
