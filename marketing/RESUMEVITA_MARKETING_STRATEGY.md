## Notes for Adam:
**Your authentic story is your biggest asset. The Navy veteran angle + engineering credentials + actual problem you solved = perfect viral formula.**

**Don't overthink it. Post consistently, engage authentically, and let the story sell itself.**

**Test everything after the site is stable. Marketing without a working product is just expensive theater.**

**Sleep well, Navy. You've earned it.** ü´°
