# dev-stack - Project Specification

**Generated:** 2025-06-21
**Type:** Web Application

## Project Overview

This specification was automatically generated from conversation analysis.

## Requirements

- capture and how you want to set it up
- capture everything without interrupting your inventive process
- have all the raw documentation for my ai project
- do that over several projects
- it done by script that is running in the background
- a persistent background script that captures everything without consuming any Claude tokens
- me to add any specific features like filtering certain file types or different output formats
- take it a step further
- me to start with a detailed technical spec for Phase 1
- start with Phase 1 - the core foundation

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Frontend:** typescript, javascript
**Backend:** python, n8n
**Apis:** claude
**Tools:** claude code

### Architecture Decisions
- Use Python with libraries like selenium or playwright to automate the browser and periodically scrape/save the conversation
- AI Agent Core
- Event-driven with message queues
- No context switching - you're already in your development environment
- Claude Code specifically:
- the Claude API directly, you naturally have all the conversation data in your code already, making logging trivial

## Features

- the full conversation context and can immediately start:
- major projects firing in no time if I get this developer stack right
- a Chrome/Firefox extension that monitors the Claude web interface and automatically saves conversations to local files
- one of these solutions? Which approach sounds most appealing for your workflow?
- markdown log with session header
- session log
- in real-time
- a project structure and let's begin building
- after becomes exponentially faster
