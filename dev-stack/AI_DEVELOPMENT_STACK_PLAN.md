# AI Development Stack - Master Plan

## Project Vision
Build a universal AI development acceleration platform that transforms one developer into a 5-person engineering team through voice interface, persistent context, and autonomous tool execution.

## Core Problem Statement
- Current AI development limited by token constraints and session breaks
- Manual tasks create friction and slow development velocity  
- Need persistent AI engineering partner that works even when developer is away
- Proven method: 4 hours from concept to deployed product (Resume Builder)

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Token Management System**
   - Real-time token usage monitoring
   - Auto-pause before 50k limit
   - Seamless session restart with context preservation
   - Persistent state tracking in project markdown

2. **Tool Orchestrator** 
   - Central brain coordinating all devstack components
   - Intelligent decision making on which tools to activate
   - Background process management
   - Tool activation/deactivation logic

### Phase 2: Production Multipliers (Weeks 3-4)
3. **Suggestion Engine**
   - Detect manual friction patterns during development
   - Suggest automation tools when patterns emerge
   - Developer choice: manual execution vs tool building
   - Persistent tracking of suggestions and implementations

4. **Voice Interface (TTS/STT)**
   - Local speech-to-text for privacy
   - Local text-to-speech for responses
   - Hands-free development workflow
   - Visual output remains on screen for reference

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Weeks 5-6)
5. **Drop-in Deployment**
   - Single folder integration for any project
   - Automatic project context detection
   - Project-specific configuration and tuning
   - Works with any programming language/framework

6. **Multi-model Support**
   - Fallback between AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Groq)
   - Automatic provider switching on failures
   - Cost optimization across providers
   - Performance monitoring per provider

### Phase 4: Monetization Ready (Future)
7. **Security Key Licensing**
   - Unique authentication per developer instance
   - License management system
   - Anti-piracy protection
   - Usage analytics and monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Current Components (Existing)
- Session logger service
- Background python scripts
- Keyboard/click tracking
- Basic spec generator

### Required New Components
- **Session State Manager**: Context compression and restoration
- **Web Browser Controller**: Autonomous web scraping and data extraction
- **File System Monitor**: Auto-update specs when code changes
- **Context Compressor**: Summarize conversations for restart
- **External API Controller**: Manage third-party service calls
- **Project Memory System**: Learn developer patterns and preferences

### Integration Points
- **Voice Layer**: Natural conversation interface
- **Persistence Layer**: Never lose context across sessions
- **Action Layer**: Autonomous external tool execution
- **Intelligence Layer**: Pattern recognition and optimization
- **Project Layer**: Drop-in functionality for any codebase

## Feature Specifications

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Real-time Logging - Tracks all AI decisions and code changes
- [ ] Voice Control - TTS/STT for hands-free development

- [ ] Multi-model Support - Fallback between different AI providers
- [ ] Context Optimization - Automatic session refresh when performance degrades
- [ ] Command Interpretation - Natural language to tool execution

### Project Management
- [ ] Drop-in Deployment - Single folder integration for any project
- [ ] Project-specific Tuning - Customize AI behavior per project
- [ ] Security Key Licensing - Per-project authentication system
- [ ] Progress Tracking - Complete audit trail of development decisions

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Mobile Development - Voice commands while walking around
- [ ] Verification Commands - Check conversation tracking before restart
- [ ] Tool Orchestration - Automatic activation/deactivation of external tools
- [ ] Recovery Protocols - Resume exactly where you left off after interruptions

## Success Metrics
- **Productivity Multiplier**: 3-5x development speed increase
- **Session Continuity**: 100% context preservation across restarts
- **Automation Rate**: 80% of manual tasks converted to automated tools
- **Revenue Potential**: $5k-10k per developer license when commercialized

## Business Model
- **Phase 1**: Internal tool for accelerating personal projects
- **Phase 2**: Proven productivity gains on 8-10 major ideas
- **Phase 3**: Commercial licensing at premium pricing
- **Target Market**: Solo developers, small teams, consultancies
- **Value Proposition**: One developer productivity of 5-person team

## Implementation Notes
- Start with token management as highest pain point
- Build orchestrator as foundation for all other tools
- Voice interface after core stability achieved
- Security/licensing only after proven market demand
- Each component should enhance the others synergistically

## Connection to Broader Vision
This devstack enables rapid execution of:
- Resume Vita scaling and feature additions
- AI trading systems development
- Medical billing automation
- Smart city infrastructure projects
- Scientific learning AI architecture
- Eventually: Standalone AI operating system

**Core Philosophy**: "You architect and think, AI handles execution"
